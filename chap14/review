1. What is an application domain?
    The area or field of application for which the software is being developed.
    Eg: Graphics / Weather Analysis / Flight testing 

2. What are ideals for naming?
    - Directly represent ideas in code (win.attach() vs win.add())
    - Inambigous
    - Readable and not too long

3. What can we name?
    Objects, variables, functions...

4. What services does a Shape offer?
    Ties graphical objects to Window object
    Properties of shapes - line, line style, points
    It has an idea of how to draw shapes

5. How does an abstract class differ from a class that is not abstract?
    It can only be used as a base class
    Cannot create an instance of an abstract class
    abstract class can be used to create an interface (force the child classes to create a method)

6. How can you make a class abstract?
    Protected constructor or Pure virtual function

7. What is controlled by access control?
    Scope of class members
    Visibility of members of base class:
        public: all functions and derived classes can use its public members
        protected: only derived classes can use public/protected members of base class
        private: public and protected members are only visible to base class itself

8. What good can it do to make a data member private?
    **encapsulation**
    Maintain data without constantly checking if a modification made was valid 
    Keep interface and implementation seperate
    Prevent unintended modification to data

9. What is a virtual function and how does it differ from a non-virtual
function?
    A virtual function of a base class allows its derived classes to override the function
    when the object is passed **generically** as the base class, and the function is called.

    Eg:
        class Base {
            public: 
                virtual void fn() {std::cout << "B::fn()";}
        };

        class Child : public Base {
            void fn() override {std::cout << "C::fn()";}
        };

        void call(Base& b) {
            b.fn();
            // without virtual: "B::fn()"
            // with virtual: "C::fn()"
        };

        int main() {
            Base b;
            Child c;
            call(c);
        }

10. What is a base class?
    Represents a concept applicable to classes derived from it 
    Allows instantiation

11. What makes a class derived?
    If it extends a base class.
    It must override all pure virtual functions

12. What do we mean by object layout?
    Structure / Format of objects in memory

13. What can you do to make a class easier to test?
    Keep it simple
    Using OOP objects

14. What is an inheritance diagram?
    Diagrams to visualize class relations
    - Arrows from derived to base classes 

15. What is the difference between a protected member and a private
one?
    Protected member is accessible by all inherited classes
    Private member is accessible only inside the class in which it is defined

16. What members of a class can be accessed from a class derived from
it?
    Visibility of members of base class:
        public: all functions and derived classes can use its public members
        protected: only derived classes can use public/protected members of base class
        private: public and protected members are only visible to base class itself

17. How does a pure virtual function differ from other virtual functions?
    It is necessary to override a pure virtual function
    This gives it the concept of an "interface"

18. Why would you make a member function virtual?
    To execute instructions different than generic instructions modelled by the base class

    Eg: Circle uses a special draw_lines() {creating arcs} but not a simple polyline

19. Why would you make a virtual member function pure?
    To mandate overridding of a specific function in the base class
    Concept of interface

20. What does overriding mean?
    To overwrite or specify a different behaviour than the default

21. How does interface inheritance differ from implementation
inheritance?
    Interface inheritance: A function expecting a Base Class {Shape} can accept a derived class {Circle}
    Implementation inheritance: The derived class gets the data and data members from the Base

22. What is object-oriented programming?
    Using objects and classes in code and applying OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
