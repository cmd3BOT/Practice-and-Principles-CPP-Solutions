/* Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is
of the form
ax2 + bx + c = 0

If you don’t know the quadratic formula for solving such an
expression, do some research. Remember, researching how to solve a
problem is often necessary before a programmer can teach the
computer how to solve it. 

Use doubles for the user inputs for a, b,
and c. Since there are two solutions to a quadratic equation, output
both x1 and x2.
